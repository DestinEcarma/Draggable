# About

Welcome to the Draggable Module for Roblox! This module provides a seamless solution for implementing draggable functionality within your Roblox games and experiences. With the deprecation of the legacy property within [GuiObjects](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/GuiObject), this module steps in to offer an efficient and reliable replacement, ensuring your GUI elements remain interactive and user-friendly.
