# Introduction

Hi there! So there was a problem with the old module, which was the Signal module that I personally made. There was also a problem with how the module was structured, and it can be hard to understand for anyone who wants to configure the module. Thus, I created a new module that is more efficient and can be easily read. For any one who still wishes to use the old module the link is [here](https://www.roblox.com/library/11263101887/Draggable-OLD).
